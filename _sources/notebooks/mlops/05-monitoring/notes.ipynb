    "Monitoring is a critical but often overlooked phase of the model life cycle[^ref]. During training, a model studies past examples. But a production model works with new data which sooner or later deviates from training data. The effects can range from [silly product recommendations](https://twitter.com/GirlFromBlupo/status/982156453396996096) to [multimillion dollar losses](https://www.fiddler.ai/blog/zillow-offers-a-case-for-model-risk-management). \n",
    "Note that the latter case demonstrates that impact on downstream business KPIs can only be noticed once damage has already been done. Hence, to operate ML models in production successfully, we need near real-time view of model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring can include: tests on model correctness, feature and target drift, prediction probability drift, data outage, schema change, underperforming segments, and so on. Adding visibility to all aspects of the data and model\n",
    "prediction pipeline give us better chances of finding out what causes change in model performance.\n",
