Experiment tracking is the process of keeping track of all relevant information in an experiments. This includes source code, environment, data, models, hyperparameters, and so on which are important for reproducing the experiment as well as for making actual predictions. \n",

    "Manual tracking, e.g. with spreadsheets, is error prone, not standardized, has low visibility, and difficult for teams to collaborate over. As an alternative, we will use the experiment tracking platform [**MLflow**](https://mlflow.org/). As we have seen with prototyping a ride duration model, having the ability to reproduce results is important since we want to have the same results when deploying the model in different environments. Using experiment tracking and model management platforms allows us to have better chance at reproducing our results, as well as aid in model management and optimization."

    "Consider the scenario where a data scientist member of our team chooses a new model for production. As deployment engineers, we naturally have the following questions in mind: What has changed in this new model? Is there any preprocessing needed? What are the dependencies? Without experiment tracking, this requires a lot of back and fort communication with the data scientist. If there is an incident in production and we had to rollback the model version, we have to go back to the email thread to determine what changed in this new version. Moreover, it might not be possible to get back the previous model (information of how it was trained has been lost). \n",

    "Recall that having a experiment tracking database and standard model files, solves most of the problems above. Having a **model registry** takes care of the last details of versioning and staging. For example, if we want to rollback models, we can only look at the archived models. Note that the model registry does not perform actual deployment of models, it only serves as standardization the process of moving models to production. Further integration with a CI/CD pipeline is needed if we want to trigger deployment steps along with the change in registry labels."
